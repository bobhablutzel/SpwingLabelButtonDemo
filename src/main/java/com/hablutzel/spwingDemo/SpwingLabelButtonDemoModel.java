 * the view, so that changes to the model are reflected

 * Spwing supports automatic saving and opening for
 * models that implement serialization. The {@link Model}
 * annotation gives the model an opportunity to define the
 * file extension of the files. By doing this, the application
 * can automatically detect when the model changes and
 * save the file as necessary.
